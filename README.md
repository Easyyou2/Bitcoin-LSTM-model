#Bitcoin Price Prediction Using LSTM and ARIMA Models


This project explores time series forecasting of Bitcoin prices using two advanced methods: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. Bitcoinâ€™s volatility presents unique challenges in prediction, making it an ideal candidate for these techniques.

The LSTM model is designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, while ARIMA serves as a statistical baseline. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared. The project also includes visualizations to compare predicted vs. actual Bitcoin prices over time.

Key tools and technologies used:

Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for model building and training
Pandas and Numpy for data preprocessing
Matplotlib for visualizing predictions and trends
LSTM and ARIMA for time series modeling
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation to replicate the analysis, as well as detailed insights into the model performance.
